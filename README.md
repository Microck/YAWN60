## Prototype

###   **Notes:** 
My unit was made with a **frosted polycarbonate case** and a **polished stainless steel weight**. These are not mandatory choices; the design allows for other  materials such as an anodized Aluminum 6063 case and/or a Brass weight.

Please be aware that this test does not accurately reflect how it will actually sound. Keep in mind that the keyboard's overall acoustics are influenced by the case, plate, foam, lubing process, recording equipment, and tons of other external factors.
